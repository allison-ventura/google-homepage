First thank you for The Odin Project in teaching people how to become a full stack web developer for free, i believe knowledge should be shared and this course does its thing, before odin project i was trying to study by myself and its much easier this way because i have a guide in order to study and im learning so much, for example i didnt know how to use the command line but now i know thank you and i hope i can learn more with this course.
